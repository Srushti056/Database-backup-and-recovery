"Database backup and recovery" refers to the process of creating a copy of a database's data (backup) to a separate location, allowing for the restoration of that data to its original state if the primary database becomes corrupted or unavailable due to system failure, accidental deletion, or other issues, essentially providing a safety net to protect critical information and ensure business continuity. Key points about database backup and recovery Purpose To prevent data loss by maintaining a readily accessible copy of the database that can be used to restore data in case of an emergency. Backup process:This involves copying the entire database or specific parts of it to a designated storage location, which can be on-premises servers or in the cloud. Recovery process:If data is lost or corrupted, the backup copy is used to restore the database to a previous working state. Backup types:Full backup: Copies the entire database at once. Incremental backup: Only copies data that has changed since the last backup, resulting in smaller backup files. Differential backup: Copies all data that has changed since the last full backup. Important considerations for database backup and recovery:Backup frequency:How often backups are taken, depending on the criticality of the data and potential for changes. Backup retention policy: How long backups are kept before being purged. Storage location: Where backups are stored, considering factors like security and accessibility. Testing procedures:Regularly testing the backup and restore process to ensure functionality in case of a real emergency.
